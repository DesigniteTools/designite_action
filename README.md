# Designite action for C# projects

## What it does?
This action analyzes your C# code using [Designite](https://www.designite-tools.com/products-cs), detects a comprehensive set of architecture, design, and implementation smells, computes a large set of object-oriented code quality metrics, and uploads the results as an artifact.
 Additionally, the action enables logging code quality analysis reports directly to [DCode](https://dcodehub.com/), our analytics platform. DCode automatically tracks and visualizes report trends, monitors code health, and supports data-driven engineering decisions.

## How to configure it?
Configuration for CI pipeline is a one-time process.

### Step 1. Obtain Personal access token and add it to GitHub secrets

- Create a new personal access token for your GitHub repository by navigating to your account’s user menu (top right) → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens. Create a new token, and if using a fine-grained token, ensure read access to Actions, Code, and Metadata.
- Add the token to your repository’s secrets by going to the repository’s Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions. Create a new secret, paste the token into the Value field, and assign a meaningful name (e.g., PAT).

### Step 2 (Optional): Add your Designite license key to secrets
If you have a Designite **Professional** or **Academic** license key, add it to your repository’s GitHub secrets as `D_KEY`. This key enables the analysis of large projects.

### Step 3 (Optional): Add your DCode project credentials to secrets
Create a new project in DCode, if not exists yet, and retrieve the _project-id_ and _api-key_ from the **Settings** menu (accessible via the three dots on the project card). Add these values to your repository’s GitHub secrets as `PROJECT_ID` and `API_KEY`. This setup allows your code quality analysis reports to be automatically logged to your DCode project, where you can monitor trends and track code health.

### Step 4: Add a GitHub Actions workflow file

This is the last and very crucial step. Create a folder `.github` on your root directory of the project and create `workflows` folder inside the `.github` folder. Create a workflow file (say `actions.yml`) in the newly created `workflows` folder. The contents of the `action.yml` file depend upon your project language and tasks.

A sample action file is provided below.

```yaml
name: CI

on:
   push:
      branches: [ main ]
   pull_request:
      branches: [ main ]

jobs:
   analyze:
      runs-on: windows-latest
      steps:
      - name: DesigniteAction
        uses: DesigniteTools/designite_action@v1.0.0
        with:
            PAT: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
            PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
            API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
```

Change the version number of action.

## What you'll get
Once configured, your repository will be analyzed on each event defined in your workflow file (in the example above, the analysis runs on every push or pull request to the main branch). The resulting report will be stored as a GitHub Actions artifact, which you can download later to review detected code quality smells and metrics for deeper analysis.

If integrated with DCode, you can automatically track code quality over time. DCode provides interactive visualizations to help you understand and monitor code health, enabling data-driven engineering decisions.
